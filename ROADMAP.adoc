The reflection utility should also define a *scope* or *context*
which is consulted by the registries and proxy creators to control
caching.

Currently, our caching applies to everything, and we cache per-type.

This might not be desired in some situations, and a more fine-grained
control over how scopes are defined can be useful.

Ideally a scope or context should be hierarchical and allow for a parent-child
relationship, so that we can have an application-level context, for instance,
which is inherited and used by the request-level context.
